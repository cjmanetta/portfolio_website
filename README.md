#Charlotte Manetta | Portfolio Website
###[live site](http://www.charlottemanetta.com) | [github pages repo](https://github.com/cjmanetta/cjmanetta.github.io)

I built this portfolio website with Github Pages, Middleman and Semantic UI. It was a great platform for learning about YAML and practicing Sass.
